                The COVID-19 pandemic in India is a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).<br>
                As of 17 August 2021, according to official figures, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with 32.2 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and the third-highest number of COVID-19 deaths (after the United States and Brazil) at 432,079 deaths.However these figures exhibit severe under-reporting.<br>
                The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported on 30 January 2020 in three towns of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic.<br>
                Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.<br>
                Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active cases.<br>
                Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.<br>
                A second wave beginning in March 2021 was much more devastating than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies in parts of the country.<br>
                By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. On 30 April 2021, it became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.<br>
                Experts stated that the virus may reach an endemic stage in India rather than completely disappear;in late August 2021, Soumya Swaminathan said India may be in some stage of endemicity where the country learns to live with the virus.<br>
                 India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021 with AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) and the indigenous Covaxin.Later, Sputnik V and the Moderna vaccine was approved for emergency use too.As of 17 August 2021, the country had administered over 550 million vaccine doses.<br>

            while treating corona patients, several frontline workers too contracted the virus and many succumbed to it.<br> 
            Our doctors and nurses, however, still continue to be on duty to treat this deadly virus. As, per the Indian Medical Association (IMA) by June as many as 776 medical professionals died in the second wave of COVID.<br>
            As per the IMA COVID register - state-wise list of doctors who died due to the second Covid-19 wave, <b>Bihar</b> had the most deaths with <b>115</b>, followed by <b>Delhi</b> with <b>109</b>, <b>Uttar Pradesh</b> with <b>79</b>, <b>West Bengal</b> with <b>62</b>, <b>Rajasthan</b> with <b>44</b>, <b>Jharkhand</b> with <b>39</b>, and <b>Andhra Pradesh</b> with <b>40</b>.<br>
            In the southern states, Karnataka had 9 doctor fatalities, Kerala had 24, and Tamil Nadu had 50. In Odisha, 34 medical professionals were killed, whereas, in Maharashtra, 23 doctors were killed.<br>
            According to the senior doctors in command of India’s national COVID care plan, there was no change in mortality between the first and second waves of COVID-19 victims.<br>
            There was a relative rise in the number of people experiencing shortness of breath as a sign of the illness, although individuals over 60, as in the previous wave, were the most vulnerable to death.<br>
            When compared to the first wave, the second wave had a “marginally higher” proportion of patients under the age of 20. In the first wave, 25.5 percent of patients were between the ages of 20 and 40, opposed to 23.7 percent in the continuing second wave.<br>
            Dr Balram Bhargava, Director-General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), stated that 47 percent of symptomatic patients in the second wave (March-April 2021) presented ‘shortness of breath’ compared to 41 percent in the first wave (Sept.-Nov.’20), citing data from a segment of hospitalised patients from the first and second waves.<br>
            All additional symptoms linked with COVID-19 — fast breathing, cough, chills, joint pain, and weariness — were more prevalent in the first wave than in the continuing second wave.
